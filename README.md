# RISC-V-SoC-Tapeout---WEEK-2

This week , the core objective is to  build a solid understanding of SoC fundamentals and practice functional modelling of the BabySoC using simulation tools (Icarus Verilog & GTKWave).

This week task is divided into two parts , they are

- Part 1 – Theory (Conceptual Understanding) - https://github.com/JITESH1101/RISC-V-SoC-Tapeout---WEEK-2/blob/main/Part-1/README.md

- Part 2 – Labs (Hands-on Functional Modelling)- https://github.com/JITESH1101/RISC-V-SoC-Tapeout---WEEK-2/blob/main/Part-2/README.md

These link will direct to the respective task of this week.

# Conclusion

By the End of Week 2 , the core components of BabySoc , their functionality , importance of Soc , their applications and demonstation of functional model verification using simulation waveforms are done 

With these learnings , Week2 is done and Week 3 is coming soon...
